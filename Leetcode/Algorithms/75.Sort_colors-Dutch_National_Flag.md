# ðŸŽ¨ Sort Colors Problem

## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

You **must not** use the library's sort function.

## âœ¨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
```
**Output:**
```cpp
[0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [2,0,1]
```
**Output:**
```cpp
[0,1,2]
```

## ðŸš€ Approach: Dutch National Flag Algorithm

### *Algorithm*

1. Use three pointers: `low`, `mid`, and `high`.
2. Initialize `low = 0`, `mid = 0`, and `high = n - 1`.
3. Traverse the array with `mid` and:
   - If `nums[mid] == 0`, swap with `nums[low]` and increment both `low` and `mid`.
   - If `nums[mid] == 1`, just increment `mid`.
   - If `nums[mid] == 2`, swap with `nums[high]` and decrement `high`.

### *Time Complexity*:
- **O(n)**, where n is the number of elements in the array.

### *Space Complexity*:
- **O(1)** extra space.

## ðŸ”¢ Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int mid = 0;
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.size() - 1;
        while (mid <= high) {
            if (nums[mid] == 0) {
                swap(nums[low], nums[mid]);
                low++;
                mid++;
            } else if (nums[mid] == 1) {
                mid++;
            } else {
                swap(nums[mid], nums[high]);
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`

---

## ðŸŒŸ Key Points

- This algorithm is an in-place solution.
- It's a one-pass solution using constant extra space.
- Known as the **Dutch National Flag** problem.
