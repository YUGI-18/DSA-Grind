# ðŸ”¢ Pascal's Triangle

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `numRows`, return the first `numRows` of Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

## âœ¨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```cpp
numRows = 5
```

**Output:**
```cpp
[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]
```

**Explanation:**
The first 5 rows of Pascal's triangle are as follows:
- Row 1: [1]
- Row 2: [1, 1]
- Row 3: [1, 2, 1]
- Row 4: [1, 3, 3, 1]
- Row 5: [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```cpp
numRows = 1
```

**Output:**
```cpp
[[1]]
```

**Explanation:**
Only the first row of Pascal's triangle is `[1]`.

## ðŸš€ Approach

1. **Initialization**: Start by creating an empty 2D vector to store the rows of Pascal's triangle.
2. **Iterating over Rows**: For each row from 0 to `numRows - 1`, create a row with `i + 1` elements initialized to 0.
3. **Set the first and last elements**: The first and last elements of each row are set to 1.
4. **Fill in the Middle Elements**: For the middle elements, each element is the sum of the two numbers directly above it from the previous row.
5. **Return the Result**: After constructing all rows, return the 2D vector representing Pascal's triangle.

### *Time Complexity*:
- **O(numRowsÂ²)**: We iterate through each row, and for each row, we fill in the elements by traversing up to `i + 1` elements.

### *Space Complexity*:
- **O(numRowsÂ²)**: We store each row in the 2D vector, and the total number of elements is proportional to `numRowsÂ²`.

## ðŸ”¢ Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> generate(int numRows) {
        vector<vector<int>> triangle; // 2D vector to store the triangle
        for (int i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
            triangle.push_back(vector<int>(i + 1, 0)); // Initialize each row
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                if (j == 0 || j == i) {
                    triangle[i][j] = 1; // First and last element in the row is 1
                    continue;
                }
                // Set the element as the sum of the two elements above it
                triangle[i][j] = triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + triangle[i - 1][j];
            }
        }
        return triangle; // Return the constructed Pascal's Triangle
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ Constraints

- `1 <= numRows <= 30`

---

## ðŸŒŸ Key Points

- Efficient row-by-row construction of Pascal's Triangle.
- Handles edge cases like `numRows = 1` correctly.
- In-place updates of each row to ensure correctness of Pascal's triangle.
