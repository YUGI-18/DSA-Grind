# ðŸ’° Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Problem Statement

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

## âœ¨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```cpp
prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
```
**Output:**
```cpp
5
```
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```cpp
prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
```
**Output:**
```cpp
0
```
**Explanation:** No transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

## ðŸš€ Approach

### *Algorithm*

1. Initialize `min = prices[0]` and `profit = 0`.
2. Traverse the prices:
   - If the current price is less than `min`, update `min`.
   - If the current price minus `min` is greater than `profit`, update `profit`.
3. Return `profit`.

### *Time Complexity*:
- **O(n)**

### *Space Complexity*:
- **O(1)**

## ðŸ”¢ Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int min = prices[0], profit = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if(min > prices[i]) {
                min = prices[i];
            }
            if(min < prices[i] && profit < (prices[i] - min)) {
                profit = prices[i] - min;
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ Constraints

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

---

## ðŸŒŸ Key Points

- Simple one-pass solution.
- Optimal in time and space.
