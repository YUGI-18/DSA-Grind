# ðŸ”€ Rearrange Array Elements by Sign

## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of even length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers.

You should return the array of `nums` such that the array follows the given conditions:

- Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
- For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in `nums` is preserved.
- The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

## âœ¨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
```
**Output:**
```cpp
[3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
```
**Explanation:** The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4]. The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [-1,1]
```
**Output:**
```cpp
[1,-1]
```

## ðŸš€ Approach

Use two pointers `pos` and `neg` to track positions for placing positive and negative numbers at alternate indices.

### *Time Complexity*:
- **O(n)**

### *Space Complexity*:
- **O(n)**

## ðŸ”¢ Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> rearrangeArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int pos = 0, neg = 1, n = nums.size();
        vector<int> ans(n, 0);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if(nums[i] > 0) {
                ans[pos] = nums[i];
                pos += 2;
            } else {
                ans[neg] = nums[i];
                neg += 2;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `nums.length` is even
- `1 <= |nums[i]| <= 10^5`
- `nums` consists of equal number of positive and negative integers

---

## ðŸŒŸ Key Points

- Maintains relative ordering.
- Ensures alternating signs.
- Starts with a positive integer.
