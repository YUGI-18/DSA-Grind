# 🔢 Merge Intervals

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [startᵢ, endᵢ]`, merge all **overlapping intervals**, and return an array of the **non-overlapping intervals** that cover all the intervals in the input.

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
**Output:** `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
**Explanation:** Intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, so they are merged into `[1,6]`.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]`
**Output:** `[[1,5]]`
**Explanation:** Intervals `[1,4]` and `[4,5]` are considered overlapping.

## 🚀 Approach

* **Sort** all intervals by their start time.
* Use a result vector `ans` to store merged intervals.
* Iterate through each interval:

  * If it does **not overlap** with the last interval in `ans`, append it.
  * If it **overlaps**, merge it with the last one by updating the end time.

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end()); // Sort by start time
        vector<vector<int>> ans;

        for (int i = 0; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
            // If no overlap, add interval
            if (ans.empty() || intervals[i][0] > ans.back()[1]) {
                ans.push_back(intervals[i]);
            } else {
                // Merge with previous interval
                ans.back()[1] = max(ans.back()[1], intervals[i][1]);
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n log n)** — Sorting the intervals.
* **O(n)** — Merging intervals in a single pass.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(n)** — Output space for storing merged intervals.

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* Always sort intervals before merging.
* Check for overlap using `interval[i][0] <= last merged end`.
* Modify in-place using the last element of result vector.
