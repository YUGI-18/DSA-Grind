# 🔍 Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## 📝 Problem Statement

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated between 1 and n times**. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

* `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated 4 times.
* `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated 7 times.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique elements**, return the **minimum element** of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in **O(log n)** time.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Find the smallest element in a rotated sorted array using binary search.

---

## ✨ Example

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
1
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
0
```

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [11,13,15,17]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
11
```

## 🚀 Approach: Modified Binary Search

### *Algorithm*

1. If the array has only one element or the first element is less than the last, return the first element.
2. Use binary search:

   * Set `low = 0`, `high = nums.size() - 1`, and `min` (uninitialized).
   * While `low <= high`:

     * Calculate `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`
     * If `nums[low] <= nums[mid]`, update `min` if `nums[low]` is less and move `low = mid + 1`
     * Else if `nums[high] >= nums[mid]`, update `min` if `nums[mid]` is less and move `high = mid - 1`
3. Return `min`

### Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size()==1 || nums[0]<nums[nums.size()-1]) return nums[0];
        int low=0, high=nums.size()-1;
        int min;
        while(low <= high){
            int mid = low + ((high - low) / 2);
            if(nums[low] <= nums[mid]){
                if(min > nums[low]) min = nums[low];
                low = mid + 1;
            }
            else if(nums[high] >= nums[mid]){
                if(min > nums[mid]) min = nums[mid];
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return min;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(log n)** — Efficient binary search.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)** — Constant space used.

---

## 🔧 Constraints

* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 5000`
* `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
* All integers of `nums` are **unique**.
* `nums` is sorted and rotated between 1 and `n` times.

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* Rotated array minimum can be found with binary search.
* Check which side is sorted in each iteration.
