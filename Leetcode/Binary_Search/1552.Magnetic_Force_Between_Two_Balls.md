# üß≤ 1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls

## üìù Problem Statement

In an alternate universe, Rick has discovered a **special magnetic force** between balls when they‚Äôre placed in baskets.

You are given:

* `position[]`: An array representing positions of `n` baskets (all distinct).
* `m`: The number of balls to place.

üëâ The **magnetic force** between two balls placed at positions `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`.

üéØ Goal:
Place all `m` balls into baskets in such a way that the **minimum magnetic force** between any two balls is as **large as possible**.
Return that maximum **minimum magnetic force**.

## ‚ú® Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `position = [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]`, `m = 3`
**Output:** `3`
‚û°Ô∏è Place balls at positions 1, 4, 7
‚Üí Forces: 3, 3
‚úÖ Minimum = 3 ‚Üí can't do better.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:** `position = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1000000000]`, `m = 2`
**Output:** `999999999`
‚û°Ô∏è Place balls at 1 and 1\_000\_000\_000
‚Üí Force = 999\_999\_999
‚úÖ That‚Äôs the max possible.

## üöÄ Simple Explanation of the Approach

We want to **maximize the smallest force** between any two balls.
This is a classic **binary search on answer** problem.

### Steps:

1. **Sort** the positions.
2. Use **binary search** to guess the answer (i.e., minimum force).

   * Try all distances between `1` and `max_distance = position[n-1] - position[0]`.
3. For each guessed force, check:
   üëâ Is it **possible** to place all `m` balls such that each ball is at least `mid` units apart?

   * Place the first ball at `position[0]`
   * For the rest, place them **greedily** where the distance is at least `mid`
4. If it‚Äôs possible, update answer and try a **larger force**.
5. If not, try **smaller forces**.

## üî¢ Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Check if we can place 'm' balls with at least 'dist' distance between them
    bool isvalid(vector<int> position, int dist, int m) {
        int cnt = 1; // first ball placed at position[0]
        int last = position[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < position.size(); i++) {
            if (position[i] - last >= dist) {
                cnt++;
                last = position[i];
            }
        }

        return cnt >= m;
    }

    int maxDistance(vector<int>& position, int m) {
        sort(position.begin(), position.end()); // step 1

        int low = 1;
        int high = position.back() - position.front(); // max possible force
        int ans = 0;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (isvalid(position, mid, m)) {
                ans = mid;       // possible ‚Üí try for more
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;  // not possible ‚Üí reduce
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## ‚è± Time Complexity

* **O(n log(maxDistance))**

  * `n` = number of positions
  * Binary search log(maxDistance) = log(1e9)
  * For each binary search step, we scan all positions ‚Üí O(n)

## üíæ Space Complexity

* **O(1)** extra space (excluding input array)

## üåü Key Takeaways

* Use **binary search on answer** when you're asked to "maximize the minimum".
* The **greedy placement** of balls helps check if a guessed force is valid.
* Always **sort** the input when working with position-based greedy logic.
