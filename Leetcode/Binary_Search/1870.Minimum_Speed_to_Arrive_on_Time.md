# 🕒 1870. Minimum Speed to Arrive on Time

## 📝 Problem Statement

You need to reach the office within a certain time `hour`.
To get there, you must take a list of `n` trains one after another. The distance of each train ride is given in an array `dist`.

👉 But there's a catch:

* **Each train can only leave at full integer hours (like 1, 2, 3...)**
  So if a ride ends at a non-integer time, you have to **wait** until the next full hour to take the next train.

* Only the **last train** doesn't have this restriction—you don’t need to wait after it.

🧠 Your task:
Find the **minimum integer speed** at which all trains should go **so that you reach on time**.
If it’s not possible, return `-1`.

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `dist = [1, 3, 2]`, `hour = 6`
**Output:** `1`
➡️ At speed 1:

* 1st train: 1/1 = 1h → wait till 1h
* 2nd train: 3/1 = 3h → wait till 4h
* 3rd train: 2/1 = 2h
  ⏱ Total = 6h → ✅ On time

---

### Example 2:

**Input:** `dist = [1, 3, 2]`, `hour = 2.7`
**Output:** `3`
➡️ At speed 3:

* 1st train: 1/3 = 0.33h → wait till 1h
* 2nd train: 3/3 = 1h → wait till 2h
* 3rd train: 2/3 = 0.66h
  ⏱ Total = 2.66h → ✅ On time

---

### Example 3:

**Input:** `dist = [1, 3, 2]`, `hour = 1.9`
**Output:** `-1`
➡️ No speed can get you there on time.

## 🚀 Simple Explanation of the Approach

We want the **smallest speed** that gets us to the office **on or before the given hour**.

To find this:

1. Try different speeds from 1 to 10 million using **binary search**.
2. For each speed, calculate the **total time taken**:

   * For all but the last train, **round up the time** (because of waiting).
   * For the last train, use exact time.
3. If the total time is within the given `hour`, store that speed and try to find a smaller one.
4. If not, try a higher speed.

## 🔢 C++ Code (Well Explained)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Check if we can reach on time with a given speed
    bool isvalid(vector<int>& dist, int speed, double hour) {
        double totalTime = 0;
        int n = dist.size();

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            // Round up time for each train except the last
            totalTime += ceil((double)dist[i] / speed);
        }

        // Last train: use exact time
        totalTime += (double)dist[n - 1] / speed;

        return totalTime <= hour;
    }

    int minSpeedOnTime(vector<int>& dist, double hour) {
        int left = 1, right = 1e7; // Search between 1 and 10 million
        int answer = -1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (isvalid(dist, mid, hour)) {
                answer = mid;        // Found a valid speed
                right = mid - 1;     // Try to find a smaller one
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;      // Need higher speed
            }
        }

        return answer;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n × log(10⁷))**
  → `n` = number of train rides
  → log factor due to binary search up to `10⁷`

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)**
  → No extra space used except a few variables.

---

## 🌟 Key Takeaways

* Use **binary search** when you're looking for a *minimum/maximum value* that satisfies a condition.
* Use `ceil()` for **rounding up** train times due to the "wait for next integer hour" rule.
* Always handle **floating-point precision** carefully in such problems.
