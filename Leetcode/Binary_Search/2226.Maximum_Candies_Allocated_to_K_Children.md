# 🍬 2226. Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children

## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given an array `candies[]` where each element represents a **pile of candies**.
You also have `k` children, and each child must receive **exactly the same number of candies** from a **single pile** (you can divide piles into smaller sub-piles, but not combine piles).

🎯 Goal:
Return the **maximum number of candies** that **each child can get**, such that **at least `k` children** receive candies.

---

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `candies = [5, 8, 6]`, `k = 3`
**Output:** `5`
➡️ Divide piles as:

* 8 → 5 + 3
* 6 → 5 + 1
  ✅ You get three piles of 5 candies → each child gets 5.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:** `candies = [2, 5]`, `k = 11`
**Output:** `0`
➡️ Total candies = 7 < 11 children → impossible
✅ So, each child gets 0.

---

## 🚀 Intuition & Approach

We want the **maximum candies per child**, so we do a **binary search** on the answer.

### Binary Search Range:

* **Low = 1** (minimum candies a child can get)
* **High = max element in candies\[]** (maximum possible from any pile)

### isValid(mid):

* Check if we can make **at least `k` piles of size `mid`** using the current `candies[]`.
* For each pile: count how many pieces of size `mid` it can create → `pile / mid`
* Sum these counts across all piles.
* If the total count ≥ `k`, it's **valid**.

### Steps:

1. Do binary search on `mid` (candies per child).
2. If `mid` is valid, store it in `ans` and try a **larger value**.
3. If not valid, try a **smaller value**.

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Helper function to check if we can serve k children with 'mid' candies each
    bool isvalid(vector<int>& candies, int mid, long long k) {
        long long children = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < candies.size(); i++) {
            children += candies[i] / mid;
        }
        return children >= k;
    }

    int maximumCandies(vector<int>& candies, long long k) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = *max_element(candies.begin(), candies.end());
        int ans = 0;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (isvalid(candies, mid, k)) {
                ans = mid;       // possible → try higher value
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;  // not enough → try smaller value
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n × log(max\_candy))**
  `n` = number of piles
  `log(max_candy)` = binary search over possible answers

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)** extra space (excluding input)

---

## 🌟 Key Insights

* You can split piles, but each child must take **from only one subpile**.
* Use **binary search on the answer** to find the max candies per child.
* Always consider edge cases: large `k`, piles with small values, etc.
