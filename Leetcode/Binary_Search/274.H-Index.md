# 📊 274. H-Index

## 📝 Problem Statement

You're given an array `citations` where `citations[i]` represents the number of citations for the **i-th paper** of a researcher.

🎯 Your task is to compute the researcher's **H-Index**.

> 💡 The **H-Index** is the **maximum value of `h`** such that the researcher has published **at least `h` papers** that have **at least `h` citations each**.

---

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]`
**Output:** `3`
➡️ The researcher has 3 papers with **≥ 3 citations**, and the rest have ≤ 3. So, H-Index = 3

---

### Example 2:

**Input:** `citations = [1, 3, 1]`
**Output:** `1`
➡️ Only 1 paper has ≥ 1 citation, and the rest have ≤ 1. So, H-Index = 1

## 🚀 Approach (Binary Search on Answer)

Instead of sorting the array or counting frequency buckets, we apply **binary search** on possible `h` values (from 1 to max citation).

### Steps:

1. Define a helper function `isvalid(mid)` that checks if at least `mid` papers have ≥ `mid` citations.
2. Perform binary search in the range `[1, max(citation)]`:

   * If `isvalid(mid)` is true, update answer and search right (try higher `h`).
   * Else, search left (try lower `h`).
3. Return the maximum valid `h` found.

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Check if at least 'mid' papers have citations >= mid
    bool isvalid(vector<int>& citations, int mid) {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < citations.size(); i++) {
            if (citations[i] >= mid) cnt++;
        }
        return cnt >= mid;
    }

    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = *max_element(citations.begin(), citations.end());
        int ans = 0;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (isvalid(citations, mid)) {
                ans = mid;       // valid h-index found
                low = mid + 1;   // try a higher one
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;  // too high, try smaller
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n × log(maxCitation))**

  * `n` = number of papers
  * `log(maxCitation)` = binary search range

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)** extra space

---

## 🌟 Key Insights

* The **H-Index** is about finding a balance point: `h` papers with at least `h` citations.
* This can be efficiently solved using **binary search on the answer**.
* The helper function `isvalid()` checks if a guess `h` is achievable.
