# 🔍 Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## 📝 Problem Statement

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct values**).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is possibly **rotated at an unknown pivot index** `k` (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]`.

Given the array `nums` after the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return the **index of target** if it is in `nums`, or `-1` if it is not.

You must write an algorithm with **O(log n)** runtime complexity.

## 🎯 Objective

Search for a target element in a rotated sorted array in logarithmic time.

## ✨ Example

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
```

**Output:**

```cpp
4
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
```

**Output:**

```cpp
-1
```

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [1], target = 0
```

**Output:**

```cpp
-1
```

## 🚀 Approach: Modified Binary Search

### *Algorithm*

1. Set `low = 0` and `high = nums.size() - 1`.
2. While `low <= high`:

   * Find `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.
   * If `nums[mid] == target`, return `mid`.
   * Determine which part is sorted:

     * If `nums[low] <= nums[mid]`, the left part is sorted.

       * If `target` is within the range `nums[low]` to `nums[mid]`, search left.
       * Else, search right.
     * If `nums[mid] <= nums[high]`, the right part is sorted.

       * If `target` is within the range `nums[mid]` to `nums[high]`, search right.
       * Else, search left.
3. Return `-1` if target is not found.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.size() - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + ((high - low) / 2);
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (nums[low] <= nums[mid]) {
                if (target >= nums[low] && target <= nums[mid]) {
                    high = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
            } else {
                if (target >= nums[mid] && target <= nums[high]) {
                    low = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    high = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(log n)** — Modified binary search over rotated array.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)** — Constant space used.

---

## 🔧 Constraints

* `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
* `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
* All values of `nums` are **unique**.
* `nums` is sorted in ascending order and may be rotated.
* `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* Binary search still works with some modifications.
* Always check which side is sorted.
