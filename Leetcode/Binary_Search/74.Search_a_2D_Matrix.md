# 🔍 Search a 2D Matrix

## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

* Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
* The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` if target is in matrix or `false` otherwise.

You must write a solution in **O(log(m \* n))** time complexity.

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
```

**Output:**

```cpp
true
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
```

**Output:**

```cpp
false
```

## 🚀 Approach

1. Treat the 2D matrix as a flat 1D array.
2. Use binary search from index 0 to `m*n - 1`.
3. Convert the mid index to 2D indices using division and modulo.
4. Compare the element with target and adjust the search space.

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
        int low = 0, n = matrix.size(), m = matrix[0].size();
        int high = (n * m) - 1;
        int row, col;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            row = mid / m;
            col = mid % m;
            if (matrix[row][col] > target) high = mid - 1;
            else if (matrix[row][col] < target) low = mid + 1;
            else return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(log(m \* n))** — Binary search over the virtual 1D array.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)** — Constant space.

---

## 🔧 Constraints

* `m == matrix.length`
* `n == matrix[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `-10^4 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10^4`

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* Transform 2D index into 1D to apply binary search.
* Efficient method for sorted 2D matrix.
