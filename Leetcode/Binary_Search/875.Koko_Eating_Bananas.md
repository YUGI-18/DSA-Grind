# 🍌 Koko Eating Bananas

## 📝 Problem Statement

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, and the `i-th` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards will return in `h` hours.

Koko can eat at a constant speed `k` bananas per hour. Each hour, she chooses one pile and eats up to `k` bananas. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them.

Return the **minimum integer `k`** such that she can eat all the bananas within `h` hours.

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
```

**Output:**

```cpp
4
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
```

**Output:**

```cpp
30
```

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```cpp
piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
```

**Output:**

```cpp
23
```

## 🚀 Approach: Binary Search

1. Use binary search on `k` from `1` to the maximum number in `piles`.
2. For each `k`, calculate the total hours Koko would take to eat all piles.
3. If the total hours is less than or equal to `h`, move to smaller `k`.
4. Else, try a larger `k`.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minEatingSpeed(vector<int>& piles, int h) {
        long low = 1, high = max(piles);
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            long value = hours(piles, mid);
            if (value <= h) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }

    long hours(vector<int>& piles, int mid) {
        long totalhour = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < piles.size(); i++) {
            totalhour += (piles[i] + mid - 1) / mid;
        }
        return totalhour;
    }

    int max(vector<int>& piles) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < piles.size(); i++) {
            if (piles[i] > max) max = piles[i];
        }
        return max;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n \* log(max(piles)))**

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)** — No extra space used

---

## 🔧 Constraints

* `1 <= piles.length <= 10^4`
* `piles.length <= h <= 10^9`
* `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9`

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* Use binary search on the answer range.
* Handle integer division with care to calculate hours properly.
