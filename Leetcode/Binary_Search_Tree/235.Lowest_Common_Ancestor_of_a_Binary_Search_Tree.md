# ğŸŒ³ 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

## ğŸ“˜ Problem Statement

Given the root of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** and two nodes `p` and `q`, find their **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**.

The LCA is the lowest node in the tree that has both `p` and `q` as descendants. A node can be a descendant of itself.

---

## âœ¨ Example

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
```

**Output:**

```cpp
6
```

**Explanation:**
The LCA of nodes `2` and `8` is `6`.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
```

**Output:**

```cpp
2
```

**Explanation:**
Node `2` is the LCA of `2` and `4` because it is a descendant of itself.

---

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```cpp
root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
```

**Output:**

```cpp
2
```

## ğŸš€ Approach: BST Property Traversal

### *Algorithm*

1. Start from the root.
2. If both `p` and `q` are **less** than the current node â†’ move to the **left subtree**.
3. If both `p` and `q` are **greater** than the current node â†’ move to the **right subtree**.
4. Otherwise, the current node is the split point â†’ return it as the LCA.

---

### *Time Complexity*

* **O(H)** â€” where `H` is the height of the BST.

### *Space Complexity*

* **O(1)** â€” iterative approach without recursion.

## ğŸ’» Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        TreeNode* cur = root;
        while(cur != NULL) {
            if(p->val < cur->val && q->val < cur->val) {
                cur = cur->left;
            }
            else if(p->val > cur->val && q->val > cur->val) {
                cur = cur->right;
            }
            else {
                return cur; // Found the split point
            }
        }
        return cur;
    }
};
```

---

## ğŸ”§ Constraints

* `2 <= number of nodes <= 10^5`
* `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
* All values are unique
* `p != q` and both exist in the tree
