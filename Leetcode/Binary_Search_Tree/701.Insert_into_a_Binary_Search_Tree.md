# ðŸŒ³ 701. Insert into a Binary Search Tree

## Problem Statement

You are given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to insert into the tree. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

There may be multiple valid ways to insert the value, as long as the resulting tree is still a valid BST.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Write a function to insert a value into a Binary Search Tree while maintaining the BST properties.

## âœ¨ Example

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
```

**Output:**

```cpp
[4,2,7,1,3,5]
```

**Explanation:**
Value 5 is inserted into the right subtree of node 2 and becomes the left child of node 7.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
root = [40,20,60,10,30,50,70], val = 25
```

**Output:**

```cpp
[40,20,60,10,30,50,70,null,null,25]
```

**Explanation:**
25 is inserted into the left subtree of 30.

---

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```cpp
root = [4,2,7,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,null], val = 5
```

**Output:**

```cpp
[4,2,7,1,3,5]
```

**Explanation:**
5 becomes the left child of 7.

## ðŸš€ Approach: Recursive BST Insertion

### *Algorithm*

1. If the `root` is `NULL`, create a new node with the value and return it.
2. If the value is less than the current nodeâ€™s value:

   * Recursively insert into the left subtree.
3. Otherwise:

   * Recursively insert into the right subtree.
4. Return the root node after insertion.

---

### *Time Complexity*:

* **Average Case:** O(log n) for balanced BST
* **Worst Case:** O(n) for skewed BST

## âœ… Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* insertIntoBST(TreeNode* root, int val) {
        if (!root) {
            TreeNode* temp = new TreeNode(val);
            return temp;
        }
        if (val < root->val) {
            root->left = insertIntoBST(root->left, val);
        } else {
            root->right = insertIntoBST(root->right, val);
        }
        return root;
    }
};
```

---

## ðŸ”§ Constraints

* `0 <= Number of Nodes <= 10^4`
* `-10^8 <= Node.val, val <= 10^8`
* All node values are **unique**
* `val` is **not** present in the tree before insertion
