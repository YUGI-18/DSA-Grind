# 200. Number of Islands

## ‚úÖ Problem:

You are given a `m x n` binary grid where:

* `'1'` = land
* `'0'` = water

An **island** is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
You need to return the **number of islands**.

## üì• Input / üì§ Output

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```
grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
```

**Output:**

```
1
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```
grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
```

**Output:**

```
3
```

## üîé Approach (BFS Traversal)

1. Traverse the grid cell by cell.
2. When you find an **unvisited land ('1')**, that means a new island starts.

   * Increment the island count.
   * Run **BFS** (or DFS) from that cell to mark all connected land cells as visited.
3. BFS uses a queue to explore all **4 directions (up, down, left, right)**.
4. Continue until all cells are visited.

## üìù Dry Run (Example 2)

**Grid:**

```
[
  [1,1,0,0,0],
  [1,1,0,0,0],
  [0,0,1,0,0],
  [0,0,0,1,1]
]
```

* Start at `(0,0)` ‚Üí land ‚Üí new island ‚Üí BFS marks connected land (`(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)`).
* Next unvisited land = `(2,2)` ‚Üí new island ‚Üí BFS marks `(2,2)`.
* Next unvisited land = `(3,3)` ‚Üí new island ‚Üí BFS marks `(3,3),(3,4)`.

‚úÖ Total islands = **3**.

## ‚úÖ Final Code (Your BFS Solution)

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    void bfs(vector<vector<char>>& grid, vector<vector<int>>& vis, int row, int col) {
        vis[row][col] = 1;
        int n = grid.size();
        int m = grid[0].size();
        queue<pair<int,int>> q;
        q.push({row,col});
        
        int drow[4] = {0,0,-1,1};
        int dcol[4] = {1,-1,0,0};
        
        while(!q.empty()) {
            int row = q.front().first;
            int col = q.front().second;
            q.pop();
            
            for(int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
                int nrow = row + drow[k];
                int ncol = col + dcol[k];
                if(nrow >= 0 && nrow < n && ncol >= 0 && ncol < m 
                && grid[nrow][ncol] == '1' && !vis[nrow][ncol]) {
                    vis[nrow][ncol] = 1;
                    q.push({nrow,ncol});
                }
            }
        }
    }

public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        int m = grid[0].size();
        int cnt = 0;
        vector<vector<int>> vis(n, vector<int>(m, 0));
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if(!vis[i][j] && grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    cnt++;
                    bfs(grid, vis, i, j);
                }
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)` ‚Üí each cell visited once.
* **Space Complexity:**

  * Visited array: `O(m * n)`
  * BFS queue: worst case `O(m * n)`
