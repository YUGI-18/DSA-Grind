# ðŸŽ¯ Two Sum Problem

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you **may not use the same element twice**.

You can return the answer in any order.

## âœ¨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
```

**Output:**

```cpp
[0,1]
```

**Explanation:** 2 + 7 = 9

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
```

**Output:**

```cpp
[1,2]
```

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [3,3], target = 6
```

**Output:**

```cpp
[0,1]
```

## ðŸš€ Approach: Hash Map

### *Algorithm*

1. Traverse through the array.
2. For each element, compute its complement (`target - nums[i]`).
3. If the complement is found in the hash map, return the indices.
4. Otherwise, store the current number and its index in the map.

### *Time Complexity*:

- **O(n)**, where n is the number of elements in the array.

## ðŸ”¢ Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        map<int,int> mpp;

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int rem = target - nums[i];

            if(mpp.count(rem)) {
                return {mpp[rem], i};
            }

            mpp[nums[i]] = i;
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i], target <= 10^9`
- Only one valid answer exists.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Key Points

- Uses a hash map to store visited elements and their indices.
- Ensures linear time complexity.
- Guarantees the unique solution by problem constraint.
