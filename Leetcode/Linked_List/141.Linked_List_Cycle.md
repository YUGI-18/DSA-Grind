# 🔁 Linked List Cycle

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
```

**Output:**

```cpp
true
```

**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
head = [1,2], pos = 0
```

**Output:**

```cpp
true
```

**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```cpp
head = [1], pos = -1
```

**Output:**

```cpp
false
```

**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

## 🚀 Approach

1. Use two pointers: a slow pointer that moves one step at a time, and a fast pointer that moves two steps at a time.
2. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.
3. If the fast pointer reaches the end (`NULL`), then there is no cycle.

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;
        while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            if (slow == fast) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n)** — In the worst case, each node is visited once.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)** — Uses only two pointers.

## 🌟 Key Points

* Uses Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare).
* Detects loop in constant space.
* Efficient and optimal for large linked lists.
