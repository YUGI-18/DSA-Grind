# 🔁 Reverse Linked List

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
head = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
[5,4,3,2,1]
```

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
head = [1,2]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
[2,1]
```

---

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```cpp
head = []
```

**Output:**

```cpp
[]
```

## 🚀 Approach

### Iterative Method:

1. Use three pointers: `prev`, `curr`, and `next`.
2. Traverse the list and reverse the direction of pointers one by one.

## 🔢 Code Implementation (Iterative)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) return head;
        ListNode* prev = NULL;
        ListNode* temp = head;
        ListNode* next = NULL;

        while (temp) {
            next = temp->next;
            temp->next = prev;
            prev = temp;
            temp = next;
        }
        return prev;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n)** — Traverse each node once.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)** — Constant extra space.

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* Can also be implemented recursively.
* This is a foundational problem in linked list manipulation.
