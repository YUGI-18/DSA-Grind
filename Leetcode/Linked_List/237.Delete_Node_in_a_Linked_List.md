# 🔁 Delete Node in a Linked List

## 📝 Problem Statement

There is a singly-linked list `head` and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted `node`. You will not be given access to the first node of `head`.

All the values of the linked list are unique, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is not the last node in the linked list.

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
```

**Output:**

```cpp
[4,1,9]
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
```

**Output:**

```cpp
[4,5,9]
```

## 🚀 Approach

1. Copy the value from the next node into the current node.
2. Delete the next node by skipping it.

> Note: This only works because we are guaranteed the node is **not** the tail.

---

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
        ListNode* nextnode = node->next;
        node->val = nextnode->val;
        node->next = nextnode->next;
        delete nextnode;
    }
};
```

---

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(1)** — Constant time to delete the node.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)** — No extra space used.

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* This solution is only valid because the node to be deleted is not the last node.
* The head of the list is not given.
* Node values are unique, simplifying deletion logic.
