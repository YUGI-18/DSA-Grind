# 🔁 Remove Nodes From Linked List

## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list.

Remove every node which has a node with a greater value anywhere to the right side of it.

Return the head of the modified linked list.

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
head = [5,2,13,3,8]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
[13,8]
```

**Explanation:** Nodes 5, 2, and 3 are removed because:

* Node 13 is to the right of 5.
* Node 13 is to the right of 2.
* Node 8 is to the right of 3.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
head = [1,1,1,1]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
[1,1,1,1]
```

**Explanation:** All nodes have the same value, so no nodes are removed.

## 🚀 Approach

1. Traverse the linked list while maintaining a stack.
2. Pop elements from the stack if the current node's value is greater.
3. Rebuild the list from the remaining stack contents in reverse.

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNodes(ListNode* head) {
       if(head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) return head;
       stack<ListNode*> st;
       ListNode* temp = head;
       while(temp){
           while(!st.empty() && st.top()->val < temp->val){
               st.pop();
           }
           st.push(temp);
           temp = temp->next;
       }
       ListNode* next = nullptr;
       while(!st.empty()){
           ListNode* node = st.top();
           st.pop();
           node->next = next;
           next = node;
       }
       return next;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n)** — Each node is pushed and popped from the stack once.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(n)** — Stack space for holding nodes.

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* Use of a monotonic stack to keep track of potential valid nodes.
* Efficient linear time algorithm for a common linked list modification pattern.
