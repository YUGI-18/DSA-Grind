# 🔀 Odd Even Linked List

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
head = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
[1,3,5,2,4]
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
[2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
```

## 🚀 Approach

1. Use two pointers: one for odd indexed nodes and one for even indexed nodes.
2. Traverse the list and separate the odd and even nodes.
3. Connect the end of the odd list to the head of the even list.
4. Return the modified list.

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* oddEvenList(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr)
            return head;

        ListNode* odd = head;
        ListNode* even = head->next;
        ListNode* evenhead = even;

        while (odd->next != nullptr && even->next != nullptr) {

            odd->next = even->next;
            odd = odd->next;

            even->next = odd->next;
            even = even->next;
        }
        odd->next = evenhead;
        return head;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n)** — Each node is visited once.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)** — Constant extra space.

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* Separates nodes into odd and even index positions.
* Preserves the original relative order of nodes.
* Achieves linear time and constant space.
