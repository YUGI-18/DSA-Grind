# 🔢 Sudoku Solver

## 🧩 Problem Statement:

You are given a **9x9** Sudoku board (a 2D grid of characters). Some cells are filled with digits `'1'` to `'9'`, and the empty cells are filled with the character `'.'`.

Your task is to **fill in all the empty cells** so that the final board represents a valid Sudoku solution.

## ✅ Rules of a Valid Sudoku:

1. Each **row** must contain the digits `'1'` to `'9'` exactly once.
2. Each **column** must contain the digits `'1'` to `'9'` exactly once.
3. Each of the **9 sub-grids (3x3 boxes)** must also contain the digits `'1'` to `'9'` exactly once.

> You must **modify the input board in-place** (i.e., do not return a new board).
> It is **guaranteed** that the input board has **only one solution**.

## ✨ Example

**Input:**

```
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
 ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
 [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
 ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
 ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```

**Output:**

```
[["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],
 ["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],
 ["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],
 ["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],
 ["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],
 ["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],
 ["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],
 ["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],
 ["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]]
```

## 🚀 Approach

1. **Backtracking** is used to try filling digits from '1' to '9' in each empty cell.
2. For each digit:

   * **Check if valid** in the current row, column, and 3×3 box.
   * If **valid**, fill the cell and recursively solve the rest of the board.
   * If it leads to a dead-end, **backtrack** by resetting the cell to '.'.
3. The algorithm returns once the board is fully and correctly filled.

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void solveSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        solve(board);
    }

    bool solve(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == '.') {
                    for (char c = '1'; c <= '9'; c++) {
                        if (isValid(board, i, j, c)) {
                            board[i][j] = c;
                            if (solve(board)) return true;
                            board[i][j] = '.';  // Backtrack
                        }
                    }
                    return false;  // No valid number found
                }
            }
        }
        return true;  // All cells filled
    }

    bool isValid(vector<vector<char>>& board, int row, int col, char c) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            // Check row, column, and 3x3 sub-box
            if (board[i][col] == c) return false;
            if (board[row][i] == c) return false;
            if (board[3 * (row / 3) + i / 3][3 * (col / 3) + i % 3] == c) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity
  Worst case: O(9^(n \* n)) where n = 9 — this is exponential due to the backtracking, but due to pruning and early return, it works fast in practice.

## 💾 Space Complexity

  * O(1) extra space (excluding recursion stack).
  * The board is modified in-place.

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* Efficient and clean.
* Leverages standard Sudoku constraints.
* Good job including 3×3 sub-box checks using math:
  `3*(row/3) + i/3` and `3*(col/3) + i%3` — this is **key**.
