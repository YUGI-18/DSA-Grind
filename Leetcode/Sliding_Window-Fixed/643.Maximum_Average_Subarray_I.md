# 🔢 Maximum Average Subarray I

## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `n` elements, and an integer `k`.

Find a **contiguous subarray** whose length is equal to `k` that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than `10^-5` will be accepted.

## ✨ Example

### Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4`
**Output:** `12.75000`
**Explanation:** Maximum average is `(12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75`

### Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [5], k = 1`
**Output:** `5.00000`

---

## 🚀 Approach

* Use a **sliding window** of size `k`.
* Add elements to the window until its size is `k`.
* After that, slide the window forward by removing the first element and adding the next.
* At each step, update the maximum average if the current window's average is greater.

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double findMaxAverage(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        double ans = INT_MIN, curr = 0;
        int l = 0;
        
        for(int r = 0; r < nums.size(); r++) {
            curr += nums[r];
            if (r - l + 1 > k) {
                curr -= nums[l];
                l++;
            }
            if (r - l + 1 == k) {
                ans = max(ans, curr / k);
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n)** — Each element is processed once in the sliding window.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)** — Constant space used.

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* Sliding window technique is optimal for fixed-size subarray problems.
* Ensure floating point division for accurate average computation.
