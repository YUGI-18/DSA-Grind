# 🔢 Max Consecutive Ones III

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a **binary array** `nums` and an integer `k`, return the **maximum number of consecutive `1`s** in the array if you can flip **at most `k` `0`s**.

---

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]`, `k = 2`
**Output:** `6`
**Explanation:** Flipping the two `0`s at indices 3 and 4 results in a sequence of six `1`s.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
`nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]`,
`k = 3`
**Output:** `10`

---

## 🚀 Approach

* Use the **sliding window** technique.
* Expand the window to include at most `k` zeroes.
* When the number of zeros exceeds `k`, shrink the window from the left until the condition is valid again.
* Keep track of the maximum window length.

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int maxi = INT_MIN, l = 0, curr = 0;

        for (int r = 0; r < nums.size(); r++) {
            if (nums[r] == 0) curr++;

            while (nums[r] == 0 && curr > k) {
                if (nums[l] == 0) curr--;
                l++;
            }

            maxi = max(maxi, r - l + 1);
        }

        return maxi;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n)** — Each element is visited at most twice.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)** — Constant extra space.

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* Sliding window is ideal for **maximum/minimum subarray with condition**.
* Greedy expansion and controlled shrinking ensure optimal performance.
