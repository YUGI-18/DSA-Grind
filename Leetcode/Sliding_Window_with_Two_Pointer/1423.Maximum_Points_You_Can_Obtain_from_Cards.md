# 🃏 Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards

## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given an array `cardPoints` representing points on cards placed in a row and an integer `k`.
You can pick exactly `k` cards **from the start or end** of the array.
Return the **maximum score** you can obtain.

---

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1]`, `k = 3`
**Output:** `12`
**Explanation:** Pick last 3 cards → `6 + 5 + 1 = 12`.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `cardPoints = [2,2,2]`, `k = 2`
**Output:** `4`

### Example 3:

**Input:** `cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9]`, `k = 7`
**Output:** `55`
**Explanation:** Take all cards.

## 🚀 Approach

* Initially, pick the **first `k` elements** as your sum.
* Slide a window:

  * For every step, remove one from left and add one from right.
  * Keep track of the **maximum sum** possible in this process.
* This simulates all combinations of picking `i` cards from the front and `k-i` from the end.

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxScore(vector<int>& cardPoints, int k) {
        int maxsum = 0, leftsum = 0, rightsum = 0;
        int right = cardPoints.size() - 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            leftsum += cardPoints[i];
        }

        maxsum = leftsum;

        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            leftsum -= cardPoints[i];
            rightsum += cardPoints[right];
            right--;
            maxsum = max(maxsum, leftsum + rightsum);
        }

        return maxsum;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(k)** — Sliding window on at most `k` elements.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)** — Only variables used, no extra space.

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* Use **two-pointer** or **prefix-suffix** approach.
* Sliding window is efficient for fixed-size subarrays.
* Explore all combinations of `front + back = k`.
