# 🔠 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the **length** of the longest substring **without repeating characters**.

---

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `s = "abcabcbb"`
**Output:** `3`
**Explanation:** The substring `"abc"` is the longest without duplicates.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `s = "bbbbb"`
**Output:** `1`
**Explanation:** The substring `"b"` is the longest without duplicates.

### Example 3:

**Input:** `s = "pwwkew"`
**Output:** `3`
**Explanation:** The substring `"wke"` is the longest without duplicates.

## 🚀 Approach

* Use a **sliding window** technique with two pointers `l` and `r`.
* Maintain a **hash array** to store the last index of each character.
* If a character repeats within the current window, move the `l` pointer to one position right of the last occurrence.
* Update the maximum window size as you go.

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        if(s.size() == 1) return 1;
        vector<int> hash(256, -1);  // ASCII hash map
        int l = 0, maxlen = 0, r = 0, n = s.size(), len = 0;

        while (r < n) {
            if (hash[s[r]] != -1 && hash[s[r]] >= l) {
                l = hash[s[r]] + 1;
            }
            len = r - l + 1;
            maxlen = max(len, maxlen);
            hash[s[r]] = r;
            r++;
        }

        return maxlen;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n)** — Each character is visited at most twice.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)** — Since the hash size is fixed (256 ASCII characters).

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* Sliding window is efficient for substring problems.
* Reset the left pointer only when a **duplicate is within the current window**.
* Use character-to-index hash mapping to quickly detect repeats.
