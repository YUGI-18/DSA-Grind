# 🔢 Next Greater Element II

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a **circular integer array** `nums` (i.e., the next element of `nums[nums.length - 1]` is `nums[0]`), return the next greater number for every element in `nums`.

The **next greater number** of a number `x` is the first greater number to its **traversing-order next** in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return `-1` for this number.

## ✨ Example

### Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,1]`
**Output:** `[2,-1,2]`

### Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4,3]`
**Output:** `[2,3,4,-1,4]`

## 🚀 Approach

* Traverse the array twice (simulate circular array).
* Use a **monotonic decreasing stack** to store potential next greater elements.
* Use `i % n` to wrap around the array.
* Only store result for the first `n` iterations (`i < n`).

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> nextGreaterElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> res(n, -1);  // Initialize result with -1
        stack<int> st;

        for (int i = 2 * n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int index = i % n;
            while (!st.empty() && nums[index] >= st.top()) {
                st.pop();
            }
            if (i < n) {
                if (!st.empty()) res[index] = st.top();
            }
            st.push(nums[index]);
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n)** — Each element is pushed and popped at most once.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(n)** — Stack holds at most `n` elements.

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* Use stack to keep track of next greater values.
* Use circular logic via `i % n`.
* Traverse `2n` times to simulate wrapping around the array.
