# 🌲 Same Tree

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
true
```

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
false
```

---

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```cpp
p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
false
```

## 🚀 Approach

1. If both nodes are `NULL`, return `true`.
2. If one of them is `NULL`, return `false`.
3. Recursively check if current node values are equal and both left and right subtrees are same.

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (p == NULL || q == NULL) return (p == q);
        return (p->val == q->val) &&
               isSameTree(p->left, q->left) &&
               isSameTree(p->right, q->right);
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n)** — where `n` is the number of nodes in the smaller tree (since we must check each node).

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(h)** — where `h` is the height of the tree due to recursive calls.

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* This is a classic tree comparison problem.
* Uses recursion to traverse both trees simultaneously.
