# 🌳 Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
3
```

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
root = [1,null,2]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
2
```

---

## 🚀 Approach

1. If the root is `NULL`, return 0.
2. Recursively find the depth of the left subtree.
3. Recursively find the depth of the right subtree.
4. The depth of the tree is 1 + max(left depth, right depth).

---

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root == NULL) return 0;
        int left = maxDepth(root->left);
        int right = maxDepth(root->right);
        return 1 + max(left, right);
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n)** — each node is visited once.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(h)** — where h is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack).

---

## 🔧 Constraints

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* Recursive approach simplifies the depth calculation.
* Tree depth is the longest path from root to any leaf.
