## 🧩 Problem: **Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum**

Given the root of a binary tree, return the **maximum path sum** of any **non-empty path**. A path can start and end at **any node** in the tree.

---

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```
root = [1,2,3]
```

**Output:**

```
6
```

**Explanation:**
The optimal path is `2 → 1 → 3`, which gives `2 + 1 + 3 = 6`.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```
root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
```

**Output:**

```
42
```

**Explanation:**
The optimal path is `15 → 20 → 7`, which gives `15 + 20 + 7 = 42`.

---

## ✅ Code (Your solution – optimized DFS approach):

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        int maxpath = INT_MIN;
        height(root,maxpath);
        return maxpath;
    }
    int height(TreeNode* root,int &maxpath){
        if(root == NULL) return 0;
        int left = max(0,height(root ->left , maxpath));
        int right = max(0,height(root ->right , maxpath));
        maxpath =max(maxpath,left + right+ root->val);
        return max(left,right)+root->val;
    }
};
```

---

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(N)**, where **N** is the number of nodes in the tree.
  We visit each node exactly once during the DFS traversal.

---

## 📦 Space Complexity

* **O(H)**, where **H** is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack.

  * Worst case (skewed tree): O(N)
  * Best case (balanced tree): O(log N)

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

* This problem is a classic application of **postorder traversal** (left → right → node).
* You must handle **negative values carefully** — only consider paths with **non-negative gains** when extending paths upward.
* The trickiest part is realizing that the **maximum path** can be a **"V shape"** (left → root → right), not just linear.

This solution is optimal and elegant using recursion and a single variable to keep track of the best path globally.
