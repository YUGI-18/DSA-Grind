# 🌳 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a **complete binary tree**.

Return the **number of nodes** in the tree.

> A *complete binary tree* is a binary tree where every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

Additionally, design an algorithm that runs in **less than O(n)** time complexity.

## 📥 Input

* `root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`

## 📤 Output

* `6`

---

## ✅ Your Code (C++ — **As It Is**)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root==NULL) return 0;
        int left = leftheight(root);
        int right = rightheight(root);
        if(left == right) return (1<<left)-1 ;
        return 1 + countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right);
    }

    int leftheight(TreeNode* node){
        int height=0;
        while(node){
            height++;
            node = node->left;
        }
        return height;
    }

    int rightheight(TreeNode* node){
        int height=0;
        while(node){
            height++;
            node = node->right;
        }
        return height;
    }
};
```

## 🔍 Dry Run (Example: root = \[1,2,3,4,5,6])

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \  /
    4  5 6
```

* From the root (1), leftmost height = 3 (1 → 2 → 4)
* Rightmost height = 3 (1 → 3 → 6)
* Since both heights are equal, it's a **perfect tree**, so nodes = 2^3 - 1 = 7 ❌ (But 3 → right → null ⇒ only 6 is there → not perfect)
* Heights differ → recurse on left and right subtrees.
* Final total = 6 ✅

---

## 💡 Approach

1. **Understand Perfect Subtree:**

   * A perfect binary tree has `2^h - 1` nodes.
   * If left height == right height → perfect → compute directly.
2. **Divide & Conquer:**

   * If not perfect, recursively count left and right subtrees.
   * Add 1 (for current root) + left count + right count.

This technique avoids visiting every node, achieving better than `O(n)`.

---

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(log^2 N)`

  * At each node, computing left and right height takes `O(log N)`.
  * And we do this for `O(log N)` levels (in worst-case unbalanced).
* **Space Complexity:** `O(log N)` (recursive stack depth)
