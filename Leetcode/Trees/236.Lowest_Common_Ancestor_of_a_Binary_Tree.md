# üå≥ 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

## üìù Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, and two distinct nodes `p` and `q`, return their **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**.

> According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
> ‚ÄúThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the **lowest node** in `T` that has **both `p` and `q` as descendants** (a node can be a descendant of itself).‚Äù

## ‚ú® Examples

### Example 1:

```
         3
       /   \
      5     1
     / \   / \
    6   2 0   8
       / \
      7   4
```

**Input:** `root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]`, `p = 5`, `q = 1`
**Output:** `3`
**Explanation:** LCA of 5 and 1 is 3.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:** `p = 5`, `q = 4`
**Output:** `5`
**Explanation:** Node 5 is an ancestor of node 4.

---

### Example 3:

**Input:** `root = [1,2]`, `p = 1`, `q = 2`
**Output:** `1`

## ‚úÖ Approach

* Use **post-order traversal** (DFS) to explore both left and right subtrees.
* Base Case:

  * If the current node is `NULL`, return `NULL`.
  * If current node is equal to `p` or `q`, return the current node.
* Recursive Case:

  * Recurse left and right.
  * If **both left and right are non-null**, then current node is the **LCA**.
  * If **only one side returns non-null**, propagate that node upwards.

## üß™ Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (root == NULL || root == p || root == q) return root;
        
        TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
        
        if (left == NULL) return right;
        else if (right == NULL) return left;
        else return root;
    }
};
```

---

## üîç Dry Run (Example 1: p=5, q=1)

* Recurse into left and right subtree.
* Left returns node 5, Right returns node 1 ‚Üí return current node (3) as LCA.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(N)` ‚Äî Visit each node once.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(H)` ‚Äî Due to recursion stack; `H = height` of tree.
