# 🌲 Diameter of Binary Tree

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
root = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
3
```

**Explanation:** The longest path is \[4,2,1,3] or \[5,2,1,3].

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
root = [1,2]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
1
```

---

## 🚀 Approach

1. Define a helper function `height` to compute the height of the tree.
2. At each node, calculate the sum of the height of its left and right subtrees.
3. Keep track of the maximum value of this sum (which is the diameter).

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int max1 = 0; 
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        height(root);
        return max1;
    }

    int height(TreeNode* root){
        if(root == NULL) return 0;
        int left = height(root->left);
        int right = height(root->right);
        max1 = max(max1, left + right);
        return 1 + max(left, right);    
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n)** — each node is visited once.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(h)** — where h is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack).

---

## 🔧 Constraints

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* The diameter can be between any two nodes, not necessarily through the root.
* The key is computing the longest path through each node.
