# 💧 Trapping Rain Water

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

## ✨ Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
`height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`
**Output:**
`6`
**Explanation:**
The elevation map can trap **6 units** of water.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
`height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]`
**Output:**
`9`

## 🚀 Approach (Two Pointer Method)

* Initialize two pointers: `left` at 0 and `right` at `n-1`.
* Track `leftMax` and `rightMax` heights.
* Water trapped at a position is: `min(leftMax, rightMax) - height[i]`
* Move the pointer with the smaller current height.

## 🔢 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int trap(vector<int>& height) {
        int left = 0, right = height.size() - 1;
        int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0, total = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            if (height[left] <= height[right]) {
                if (height[left] < leftMax) {
                    total += leftMax - height[left];
                } else {
                    leftMax = height[left];
                }
                left++;
            } else {
                if (height[right] < rightMax) {
                    total += rightMax - height[right];
                } else {
                    rightMax = height[right];
                }
                right--;
            }
        }

        return total;
    }
};
```

## ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n)** — Single pass through the array using two pointers.

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(1)** — Constant extra space used.

---

## 🌟 Key Points

* No need to precompute left/right max arrays.
* Two-pointer method is optimal in both time and space.
